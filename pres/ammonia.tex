	Outdoor air pollution contributes to millions of global premature deaths annually, with  most health impacts air linked to fine particulate matter (PM\textsubscript{2.5}) \citep{Lelieveld2015}. 	Due to atmospheric reactions between alkaline ammonia (NH\textsubscript{3}) and acidic nitrogen oxides (NO\textsubscript{x}) and sulphur dioxide (SO\textsubscript{2}), that contribute to the formation of PM\textsubscript{2.5}, an optimal air pollution mitigation strategy should consider agricultural emissions (which primarily account for ammonia) as well as those from the transport and power sectors \citep{Wang2015, Lee2015}. Ammonia's contribution to premature mortality varies by region; in parts of Europe and North-Eastern America, reductions in Ammonia emissions may generate the largest reductions in mortality, although these results are sensitive to uncertainties about the relative toxicity of PM\textsubscript{2.5} particles by source \citep{Lee2015, Lelieveld2015}. Mitigation options for ammonia emissions are higher than other sectors, but behavioural changes towards reducing meat consumption would be highly effective, and would also generate health benefits for humans, a reduction in GHG emissions, a reduction in biodiversity loss, and the improvement of water quality \citep{Backes2016, Leip2015}.
